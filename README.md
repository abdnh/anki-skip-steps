This Anki add-on modifies the schedulder such that relearning steps larger than the time passed since the last review date of a card are skipped. Only works with the [V3 scheduler](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html). The add-on was written as an experiment after I saw this [forum post](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/would-it-be-possible-to-make-an-add-on-that-skips-relearning-steps/25256) and has not received any actual tests yet, so use at your own risk.

To activate the add-on after installation, click on the _Tools > Skip (Re)Learning steps > Override custom scheduling code_ menu item.

The add-on currently only skips relearning steps. Support for skipping learning steps may be added in the future.
